###**Why Open Source**

Honestly, I’m just taking this class because it’s a required course. I’ve heard of open source, but never really gave it much thought. I picked this course over the other options because I have some familiarity with the subject matter. A prior professor had us do a basic study on open source which piqued my interest. I always thought it was interesting how open source is available to the public and how anyone can access it. Hopefully, through this course, I will be able to learn how to manipulate this open database for myself.
